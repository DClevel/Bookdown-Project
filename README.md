This bookdown, the first bookdown I've created, was compiled to present six of the assignments from ESS 580 - Introduction to Data Science at Colorado State University.

Many thanks to Yihui Xie (http://yihui.org), who authored the bookdown that teaches how to begin making yours. (https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)
